1. representing marbles

I plan to represent marbles by giving 10 predefined marble colors and having the user tell me how many marbles they have of each color

2. A way to add marbles to the bag

since the marbles will probably be stored inside of an array to increase the amount of a specific marble I would increment that array adress

3. Pull a random marble out

The best way to "pull" a random marble out is to get a random number between 0 and n-1 where n is the size of your array that's storing the bags. Then decrement that adress by 1 and maybe notify the user which marble they have grabbed

4. Tests

Good test for this project might be: Testing what happens at the upper and lower bounds of your bag size, if it limits input to marble colors and the amount
